## Key Details

### Project Summary: Influence of Loyalty Programs in Fast Food Retail

This project investigates the effectiveness of loyalty programs in the fast-food industry, evaluating their impact on customer preferences, spending habits, and brand loyalty. Using a mixed-methods approach—including surveys, interviews, and financial data analysis—we explored how these programs influence consumer behavior and whether they justify the investment by fast-food companies.

Key findings reveal that while loyalty programs can enhance customer retention when well-designed, they generally have a limited impact on dining choices or spending habits. Customers prioritize food quality, price, and convenience over loyalty rewards. Simplifying program structures and offering immediate, flexible benefits could improve their appeal. Additionally, other factors like superior customer service and competitive pricing were identified as more critical to driving customer satisfaction and repeat visits.

Our research also uncovered that mobile app experiences play a significant role in shaping perceptions of loyalty programs, with tech-savvy users favoring seamless digital integration. However, many non-users find the sign-up process cumbersome and rewards insufficient to justify participation.

### My Contribution

I focused on sampling strategies and fine-tuning survey instruments to ensure clarity and minimize bias in responses. This involved leveraging convenience and snowball sampling methods while tailoring survey questions to capture nuanced consumer behaviors. My efforts contributed to gathering high-quality data that accurately represented our target demographic.

In the final presentation, I was praised for my emphatic opening, compelling storytelling, and effective delivery, which successfully engaged the audience and conveyed the project's significance.
